# Design Tokens

**Note:** This plugin is currently in a beta phase. If you find any bugs / issues or have feature ideas please [create an issue](https://github.com/lukasoppermann/design-tokens/issues/new).

The **Design Tokens** plugin for figma allows you to export design tokens into a json format that can be used with the [Amazon style dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/) package. This allows you to transform your tokens to different languages / platforms like web, iOS or Android.
